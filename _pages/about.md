As a Master's student in Computer Engineering at NYU, I am deeply passionate about crafting resilient and scalable software solutions. Currently, I am on the lookout for full-time roles, particularly in technology and finance.

My background includes extensive experience in backend development, with a focus on Microservices and `Python/Django` frameworks; Machine Learning, utilizing tools like `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `PyTorch`, and `scikit-learn`; and Cloud Engineering, proficient in `Terraform`, `AWS`, `Azure`, and `GCP`. I am skilled in utilizing `Docker`, `Kubernetes`, `Kafka`, `BigQuery`, and databases such as `MongoDB`, `Postgres`, and `Redshift`. Additionally, I have worked on `fine-tuning LLMs` and `diffusion models` for generative AI applications and am actively conducting research on `security in ML/AI systems`, exploring vulnerabilities and defenses in AI-driven solutions.

My recent professional experiences include building tools to improve investment and hiring strategies in the VC space with Endless Frontier Labs, and delivering a core service at an AI-based marketing startup, Hype AI, increasing customer satisfaction with our services.

I'm keen to connect with like-minded professionals and organizations where I can further contribute and grow. If you're looking for someone eager to take on new challenges and drive meaningful advancements in technology, let's start a conversation!
