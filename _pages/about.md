As a Master's student in Computer Engineering at NYU, I am deeply passionate about crafting resilient and scalable software solutions. Currently, I am on the lookout for Internship opportunities for Summer 2024, particularly in Software Engineering, Machine Learning, Data Engineering, or Cloud Engineering, open to exploring opportunities globally.

My background includes extensive experience in backend development, with a focus on Microservices and Python/Django frameworks; Machine Learning, utilizing tools like `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `PyTorch`, and scikit; and Cloud Engineering, proficient in Terraform, AWS, and GCP. I am skilled in utilizing Docker, `Kubernetes`, `Kafka`, `Splunk`, `BigQuery`, and databases such as `MongoDB`, `Postgres`, `Snowflake`, and `Redshift`.

My recent professional experiences include developing advanced cyber threat detection systems for Deloitte serving Fortune 500 clients. I'm also actively involved in the open-source community, contributing to developing an innovative, no-code tool to enhance LLM tuning. These roles have sharpened my technical skills and underscored the importance of impactful engineering solutions.

I'm keen to connect with like-minded professionals and organizations where I can further contribute and grow. If you're looking for someone eager to take on new challenges and drive meaningful advancements in technology, let's start a conversation!
